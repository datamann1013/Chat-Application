## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
- To run this application, ensure you have:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed.
- Basic understanding of command-line tools for starting the server and client.

### Installation
1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/datamann1013/javaChatApp

- Then start one or more client instances to connect to the server.

### Joining the chat
