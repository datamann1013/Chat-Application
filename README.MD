## How to use

### Starting the application

- Run the server first. The server listens on port 5000 by default.
- Then start one or more client instances to connect to the server.

### Joining the chat

- Enter your name in the prompt when starting the client application.
- Begin typing messages in the text field and press Enter to send.

### Exiting the chat

- Click the Exit button to leave the chat. A message will notify others that you have left.

## Known issues / Improvements to be made


- The server does not currently handle user authentication.
- If the server disconnects, the clients may not recover gracefully.
- Messages are broadcast to all users without private messaging support.

- Implement private messaging.
- Add user authentication (e.g., username and password).
- Enable multiple chat rooms.
- Improve error handling for server-client disconnections.
